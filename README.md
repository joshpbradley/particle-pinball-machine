# Particle Pinball Machine

Project completed in 2022 - year 4 of MSci Computer Science degree.

This project gamifies the emission of energetic solar radiation, with the aim of the game being to cause as much disruption to the Earth's technology as possible. The emitted radiation interacts with the Earth's atmosphere, causing a scattering of particles - with more particles colliding with the Earth representing a larger potential for disruption.

**CONTEXT**

This project was developed for Hybrid Instruments Ltd as a part of my academic industrial placement with Lancaster University. The final build included in the repository was showcased at the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition 2022 to educate the public on the research the university is conducting, to protect against potentially devastating technological disruption due to space weather.

**CONTROLS**

The game is intended to be interacted with via the Microsoft Kinect to track gesture, so that the player can emit space weather with a swipe of the left hand across the body, from left to right. The game can be reset at any time by pressing the R key.

The player's aim is to swipe as fast as possible, while timing the swipe so that the Sun is in its most energetic state (signified by its red hue and the level of the progress bar). Both of these mechanics, when optimised, cause as much disruption to the Earth as possible by increasing the scale of the particle shower.

When used on a system that does not support the Microsoft Kinect, the swipe can be bypassed using the space bar. Without the ability to swipe, the aim is to simply time the pressing of the space bar so that the Sun is in its most energetic state.
